A Filesystem Zoo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is just some junk code that I have written to understand
the disk layouts of various filesystems by implementing them
read-only in FUSE.  Don't expect great things in terms of code
style, performance, or correctness.  That said, the devices are
opened read-only in user mode, so (probably) no harm can come
from the programs.

Synopsis
--------

$ ./ext2_fuse -a /dev/sda1 -f -d mnt
$ fusermount -u mnt

$ ./yaffs2_fuse -a system.img -f -d mnt
$ fusermount -u mnt

Bugs
----
- Multithread doesn't work due to conspicuous lack of locking
- Nor do various types of links
- YAFFS2 assumes certain MTD geometries that happen to match my phone
